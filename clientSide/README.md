<h3>How to use the project:</h3>

The chat has 3 routes.
(3000 is the default port)
1) Login - http://localhost:3000
2) Register - http://localhost:3000/register
3) Chat - http://localhost:3000/chat

The server (and only the server) holds some hard-coded users.
each user has username and password used for login

Once you login or register you will be logged to the user's chat related.

Please login to the following user:
username: bob2
password: 12345

This user has some hard-coded messages and contacts as required in the assignment requirements.
to log to his hard-coded contacts you can use:
username: alice
password:1234

or

username: bob
password: 123

Some information for the Register page:
The page asks you for username,nickname,  password.

- Username  Must be unique. In case you enter a username that's already in the system it will not let you use this name and ask you to change. (Be advised that there are some hard-coded users in the server which appears at the bottom of the README)

- nickname is the name you'll see yourself in the chat screen

- Password: must contain at least 5 characters with at least one digit and one special character     (!@#$%^&*)
  for example "12345!" is a good password



The server's hard coded users are listed by: 
username, nickname, password
- bob2, Bobby2S, 12345 (Main user who has hard-coded chats followed by assignement requirements)
- alice, AliciaS, 1234 (bob2 has her as a contact)
- bob, BobbyS, 123 (bob2 has him as a contact)
- Elad, Elad56S, 12
- Michael, Michael12S, 12345

please note that the hard-coded passwords don't allign with password requirement as it just for making the login easier.
